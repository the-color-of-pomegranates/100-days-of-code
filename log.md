# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: april 6th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: forked #100 days of code repo, set up accounts, brainstormed project idea, started html wireframe

**Thoughts:** it has been so long since i've typed anything on the command line that i felt like a total beginner. interested to see i feel completely overwhelmed even if it's to be expected.

### Day 1: april 7th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: tried to make a little app using twilio and giphy

**Thoughts:** oh boy, what a mess! can get giphy api working but not sure how to hook it up to server side javascript needed to send text via twilio - to work on tomorrow

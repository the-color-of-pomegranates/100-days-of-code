**Thoughts:** it has been so long since i've typed anything on the command line that i felt like a total beginner. interested to see i feel completely overwhelmed even if it's to be expected.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

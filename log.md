# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: april 6th, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: forked #100 days of code repo, set up accounts, brainstormed project idea, started html wireframe

**Thoughts:** it has been so long since i've typed anything on the command line that i felt like a total beginner. interested to see i feel completely overwhelmed even if it's to be expected.
